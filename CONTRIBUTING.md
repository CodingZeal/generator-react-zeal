# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone :bangbang:

1. Fork, and clone the repo.
2. Make your modifications to the code.
3. Make sure your tests pass via `yarn test`.
4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests and we may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Lint your code via our eslint linter.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
* Be nice to work with.  We are all working hard so being patient helps things move along through the pipeline.
